I found this project litellary on instagram at the end of its deadline, i have in a next project already started for blueprint.

*seeed XIAO rp2040-DIP
*4x sk6812 LED

the two cables need to be cut in half, stripped and soldered to GPIO6 as sda and GPIO7 as scl, gnd and 5v. the ssd1036 has to be glued in to the hole in the top left.
